## Disclaimer

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Disclaimer</strong></summary>

This project is still considered to be in an alpha state. All apps run in the same context and can access every other app, as well as the entire virtual browserfs.

The code in this repository has not been audited. Do not rely on it to keep anything safe, and never paste commands you don't understand. Anywhere, ever.

Heavily scrutinize any application or script you install or run, as well as its authors.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:web3os-org/kernel.git
cd kernel
pnpm install # or npm install
pnpm start # or npm start
```

From here, simply connect to [https://localhost:2160](https://localhost:2160) and accept the certificate warning.

Alternatively, install [src/assets/ssl/localhost.crt](https://github.com/web3os-org/kernel/blob/master/src/assets/ssl/localhost.crt) to your trusted certificate store.

We use SSL locally so that all browser APIs work as expected.

## Autostart

<details open>
<summary><strong>Expand Autostart</strong></summary>

To modify the commands the system executes on startup:

- `edit /config/autostart.sh`
- For example, add `desktop` to the end of the file
- Insert any additional commands you want to run on startup

</details>

## Globals

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Globals</strong></summary>

---

These objects are available on the global object (globalThis/window):

- `Kernel`: The global kernel
- `Terminal`: The kernel's main terminal
- `System`: The SystemJS library

</details>

## Scripting

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Scripting</strong></summary>

---

Web3os scripts (.sh) are a simple line-by-line execution, while Javascript (.js) offers far more power.

To run a web3os script: `sh /path/to/script.sh`

- Or from an app: `window.Kernel.executeScript('/path/to/script.sh')`

To run a Javascript script: `eval /path/to/script.js`

- Or from an app: `window.Kernel.execute('eval /path/to/script.js')`

</details>

See some sample scripts at: [https://github.com/web3os-org/sample-scripts](https://github.com/web3os-org/sample-scripts)

## Web3os Package Manager

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Web3os Package Manager</strong></summary>

---

The `3pm` command can be used to manage installed packages. Installing a package adds an entry to `/config/packages` and all packages in this file are loaded on startup.

Packages are generally ES Modules, located at a url that contains a `package.json`.

You can attempt to install any package from npm using a CDN such as [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) (this is the default 3pm registry).

This means that during development, you can serve up your app locally, with Live Server for example, and `3pm install http://localhost:5500`.

You may also just use the `import` command to directly import an ES module from a URL. Or bypass all of this and use your own technique!

Dependency management is another monster altogether, so that's still a WIP. This means your package should already be bundled when web3os loads it, or pull in your dependencies some other way.

Here are a few examples of npm libraries that can be successfully loaded in web3os:

- [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)
  - `3pm install lodash`
  - This doesn't add an executable, but `_` is now available in the global scope.

- [jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery)
  - `3pm install jquery`
  - This doesn't add an executable, but `$` is now available in the global scope.

- [moment](https://momentjs.com)
  - `3pm install --umd moment`
  - `const now = Kernel.modules.moment.run()`

- [umbrellajs](https://umbrellajs.com/)
  - `3pm install umbrellajs --main umbrella.esm.js`
  - Now you can use it:
    - `const u = Kernel.modules.umbrellajs.default`
    - `const body = u('body')`

## Kernel Interface

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Kernel Interface</strong></summary>

---

This is a brief overview of how to use the kernel, please check [https://docs.web3os.sh](https://docs.web3os.sh) for updated documentation.

This (and everything else) is subject to change before version 1.0.

`window.Kernel.modules` = { name: app }

- Contains all apps registered in the kernel
- e.g., `window.Kernel.modules.desktop.run()`
- e.g., `window.Kernel.modules['@author/package'].version`

`window.Kernel.dialog` ({ ...[sweetalert2options](https://sweetalert2.github.io/#configuration) }) = :Promise(sweetalert2result)

- Convenience method to create a sweetalert2 dialog with appropriate defaults
- e.g., `window.Kernel.dialog({ title: 'Are you sure?', text: 'Scary stuff!', icon: 'warning' })`

`window.Kernel.fs` = { ...BrowserFS }

- This object holds the initialized BrowserFS instance
- e.g., `const doesExist = window.Kernel.fs.existsSync('/config/packages')`

`window.Kernel.set` ('namespace', 'key', :any)

- Sets a value in the kernel "memory" - persists in localStorage
- e.g., `window.Kernel.set('user', 'name', 'hosk')`
- e.g., `window.Kernel.set('myapp', 'theme', { color: 'rebeccapurple' })`

`window.Kernel.get` ('namespace', 'key') = :any

- Gets a value from the kernel "memory" - loaded from localStorage
- e.g., `window.Kernel.get('user')`
- e.g., `window.Kernel.get('user', 'name')`
- e.g., `const { color } = window.Kernel.get('myapp', 'theme')`

`window.Kernel.windows.create` (options) = { options, window }

- Creates a new application window with [WinBox](https://github.com/nextapps-de/winbox) options

## App Structure

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand App Structure</strong></summary>

---

Developers should be able to create apps in any way they like, with as few requirements as possible. Remember, your app is simply running in a browser - you have access to everything that any other script or module does.

To make your module executable from the command line, you may export an async function named `run`, or your default export must be a function.

Your module or `package.json` may also contain a `help` property that contians your module's help text.

The best way to create applications for web3os is to create an `npm` package, using any bundler you'd like.

For example, to create an application with [snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev):

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@yourorg/yourapp",
  "description": "A sample application",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "license": "MIT",
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "module": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "snowpack dev",
    "build": "snowpack build",
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "snowpack": "^3.8.8"
  }
}
```

`index.js`:

```js
export const help = `
  This app enables developers to Do An App!

  Usage: @yourorg/yourapp [options]        Run yourapp with some options!
`

export async function run (terminal, context) {
// or: export default function (terminal, context) {
  console.log(terminal) // the xterm.js terminal in which your app is running
  console.log(context) // the plain string of arguments passed to your app
  terminal.log('Thanks for checking out myapp!')
  terminal.log(context)

  // You may also access the web3os system terminal
  window.Terminal.log('This is output to the root globalThis.Terminal')
}
```

Apps can be written and bundled a number of different ways, for some ideas check out:

[@web3os-apps](https://github.com/web3os-org/web3os-apps)

</details>

## Backend (web3os-server)

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Backend</strong></summary>

The `backend` command is the utility to connect to and interact with backend servers. The web3os-server spins up a private Docker container for performing various server-side tasks at the request of the web3os client, authenticated with a user's wallet.

It offers multi-user capability while restricting access based on user's authenticated wallet address, or other attributes such as NFT ownership, etc.

[View the web3os-server repository](https://github.com/web3os-org/server)

</details>

## WebUSB

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand WebUSB</strong></summary>

Experimental WebUSB API features are limited in browser support at this time.

The `usb` command doesn't do much except pair and maintain a list of devices.

```text
Usage:
    usb devices            List paired USB devices
    usb request <options>  Request USB device (blank for user choice)

  Options:
    --help                 Print this help message
    --name                 Specify a friendly name for the USB device
    --product              Product ID of the USB device
    --vendor               Vendor ID of the USB device
    --version              Print the version information
```

Access the array of devices within an app: `Kernel.modules.usb.devices`

</details>

## Web Bluetooth

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand Web Bluetooth</strong></summary>

Experimental Web Bluetooth API features are limited in browser support at this time.

The `bluetooth` command doesn't do much except pair and maintain a list of devices.

```text
Usage:
    bluetooth devices            List paired bluetooth devices
    bluetooth pair <options>     Request bluetooth device (blank for user choice)

  Options:
    --help                 Print this help message
    --name                 Specify a friendly name for the bluetooth device
    --version              Print the version information
```

Access the array of devices within an app: `Kernel.modules.bluetooth.devices`
